3. When your submission is **"Accepted"**, LeetHub will automatically:
   - Extract your code, problem title, difficulty, and language
   - Push it to GitHub at: `leethub/<Difficulty>/<Problem Name>.<ext>`

### Manual Push (from Popup)

1. Open a LeetCode problem page
2. Click the LeetHub extension icon
3. Click **"Push current page"** to manually trigger a push

### View Statistics & Activity Log

1. Click the LeetHub extension icon to open the popup
2. View your statistics:
   - Total problems solved
   - Easy/Medium/Hard breakdown
3. Check recent activity log (last 10 actions)
4. Click "Refresh" to update the log

##  Repository Structure

Your GitHub repository will look like this:

```
leethub/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Easy/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Two Sum.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Reverse String.js

##  Testing the Extension

### Quick Test (5 minutes)

1. **Load the extension**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to chrome://extensions/
   # Enable Developer mode
   # Click "Load unpacked"
   # Select /Users/oumizumi/Documents/leethub
   ```

2. **Configure settings**:
   - Right-click LeetHub icon ‚Üí Options
   - Enter your GitHub credentials
   - Click "Test GitHub" (should see success message)
   - Click "Save Settings"

3. **Test on LeetCode**:
   - Go to https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
   - Submit any solution
   - Wait for "Accepted" verdict
   - Check your GitHub repo - solution should appear!

4. **Verify popup**:
   - Click LeetHub icon
   - Should see statistics and activity log
   - Try "Push Current Page" button

### Troubleshooting

**Extension not detecting submissions:**
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Verify content script loaded: look for "LeetHub content script loaded"
- Try refreshing the LeetCode page

**GitHub push failing:**
- Verify token has correct permissions (repo/public_repo)
- Check repository exists and name is correct
- Ensure branch name matches (default: main)

**Code not extracted:**
- LeetCode may have updated their DOM structure
- Check console for "Could not extract code"
- Open an issue on GitHub with browser console logs

## Privacy & Security
